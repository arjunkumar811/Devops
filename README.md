# DevOps Learning Roadmap

## Introduction
I am Arjun, a MERN stack developer currently expanding my skill set by learning DevOps. My goal is to gain expertise in automation, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and containerization to enhance my development workflow and become a well-rounded engineer.

## Current Focus
Currently, I am focusing on mastering basic Bash commands as part of my DevOps learning journey. This includes understanding file handling, process management, and scripting. Moving forward, I will dive into version control (Git), containerization (Docker), and CI/CD pipelines.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Operating Systems**: Linux (Ubuntu), Windows
- **Scripting & Automation**: Bash
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Containerization**: Docker (upcoming)
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions (upcoming)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (future learning)

## Projects
- **Bash Scripting**: Automating daily tasks and system operations.
- **Version Control Setup**: Managing projects efficiently with Git and GitHub.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (Upcoming)**: Setting up a basic pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- **Dockerized Application (Upcoming)**: Deploying a simple web application using Docker.

## Progress Metrics
- ‚úÖ Completed **Basic Bash Commands** (Week 1)
- ‚è≥ Learning **Advanced Bash Scripting** (Week 2)
- üîú Exploring **Git & GitHub Workflows** (Week 3)
- üîú Understanding **Docker & Containerization** (Week 4)
- üîú Implementing **CI/CD Pipelines** (Week 5+)
